# List of links subjected to deamplification algorithm on X

## How to find new ones: Add to bookmarks and like the post. Revisit the next day and check if the like is removed.
## More details: likes on all links removed at the same time as some kind of scheduled script, which runs several times per day.
## (trying to pin point exact times). Bookmarks and reposts are not removed. View counter removed for tier 1 links
## How to respond: You have to decide for yourself. I have all of them added to separate bookmark group and I put back the like as soon as I notice.
## Originally I had possible reasons added to each link, but as it is subjective - reasons removed, make your own conclusions on why.

## Tier 1 links, no views counter, likes removed
